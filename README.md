# Hello

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Open components>Weather.tsx. On lines 21 and 33, and input your OpenWeatherMap tokens, refer to the comments on those lines.

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

4. Download the latest release to test the app on Andriod. May be unable to fetch weather conditions since the app uses a free OpenWeatherMap token which allows a 1000 API calls/searches per day. If app is unable to fetch weather conditions, then the calls/searches per day has been exhausted by testers.
